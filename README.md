A tool for all your [Animal Crossing: New Horizons](https://www.animal-crossing.com/new-horizons)' crafting needs.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
<br/><br/>  

## Special Thanks & Credits  
This project project would *not* be possible without the following resources:
* **[Alexis](https://github.com/alexislours), [ACNH API](http://acnhapi.com/), and the rest of the Spreadsheet Crew**<br/>
Seriously, these folks are all incredible! I can't count how many hours were saved by asking questions from the amazing devs and spreasheet maintainers out there. THANK YOU.  
<br/>  

* **[Mariusz Dabrowski](https://github.com/MariuszDabrowski) of [AC Miles](https://acmiles.com/)**<br/>
This tool is *seriously* clean! I definitely used this as a reference for what a web-based, authentic Nintendo-like UI would look like. My scrollbar and animations of cards came from him. Seriously, check out this cool project if you have a moment.  
<br/>  

* **[DIY Recipes Netlify app](https://diyrecipes.netlify.app/) by [@Capstone](http://twitter.com/capstonepics)**<br/>
After picking this tool back up from an unplanned 8 month hiatus, I found a tool that worked pretty similar to my own. Capstone did a lot of heavy lifting and data organization that I was dreading and helped out a ton in structure and graphics resources! (Especially explaining how backgrounds for recipes work! ðŸ™ƒ)  
<br/>  

* **The [Nookipedia](https://www.nookipedia.com/) team**<br/>
NookDIY literally would not function without their API. The team was super nice and easy to work with. (Plus, their Discord community is pretty cool too!)   
<br/>

* **[ACNH CDN](https://acnhcdn.com/)**<br/>
These fine folks provide the images I'm currently unable to get from ACNH API or Nookipedia. It's used A LOT by AC tools out there and definitely should get some shout-out attention. (According to their site, it's sending terabytes -- yes, terabytes -- of data daily! OOF!)

## Running locally  
#### `npm i`

Ue this to install all of the dependencies for this project. You won't be able to run it locally without running this first so it's kinda important!

#### `npm start`

Run the app in the development mode via [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser<br/>
By default, the page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
